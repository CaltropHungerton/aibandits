# Active inference and multi-armed bandits
The code accompanying the paper [An empirical evaluation of active inference in multi-armed bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08699). We introduce various active inference based multi-armed bandit algorithms and compare them to existing solutions. The current focus is on stationary and switching bandits.
